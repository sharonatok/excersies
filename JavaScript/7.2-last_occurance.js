// JS – last occurrence
// The following exercise contains the following subjects:
//  methods
// Instructions
// you have this string:
// const string = "The more you know, the more you know that you
// don't know";
// We want to get the index of the last occurrence of the word
// “you”. It should give you 42.
// You can solve this problem without the method indexOf. But
// if you can manage to do it also with indexOf you will get a
// cookie.

const string = "The more you know, the more you know that you don't know";

console.log(string.lastIndexOf('you'));
